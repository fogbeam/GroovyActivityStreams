An implementation of the [ActivityStrea.ms protocol](http://activitystrea.ms/) in Groovy.  Used by
[Quoddy](https://github.com/fogbeam/Quoddy) and [Neddick](https://github.com/fogbeam/Neddick) for sending and 
receiving activity stream events.  Note that this is not a complete implementation at this time and has NOT 
been extensively tested for interoperability with other implementations.

This will continue to evolve along with Quoddy and Neddick.  Pull requests are welcome, of course.
