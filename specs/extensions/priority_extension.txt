1.  The "priority" property

   Priority is an indicator of the relative priority or importance that
   the generator of an "activity" object considers the activity to have.
   Represented in JSON as a property called "priority" whose value is a
   numeric decimal between 0.00 and 1.00.  If the property is omitted,
   or explicitly set to a value of null, the assumption is that no
   explicit priority or importance can be assumed.  All other values
   falling between 0.0 and 1.0 indicate relatively increasing priority.

   For example:

     {
       "actor": {"displayName": "Joe"},
       "verb": "post",
       "object": {
         "objectType": "note",
         ...
       },
       "priority": 0.75
     }

   Note that the presence of the "priority" property is intended only to
   communicate the intended relative importance of the activity from the
   generators point of view and does not impose any specific processing
   or display requirements on the part of any entity consuming the
   activity stream.

   Expressing the value as a range of numeric decimal values is intended
   to provide the greatest level of flexibility in the expression and
   consumption of prioritization detail.  It is expected that
   implementors consuming activity streams containing "priority" will
   utilize and expose the additional information in a number of
   different ways depending on the unique requirements of each
   application use case.

   Many existing systems do not typically represent priority values as
   numeric ranges.  Such systems typically use fixed, labeled brackets
   such as "low", "normal" and "high" or "urgent".  Similar mechanisms
   can be established, by convention, when using the "priority"
   property.  In typical use, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations
   wishing to work with such defined categories treat "priority"
   property values in the range 0.00 to 0.25 as "low" priority; values
   greater than 0.25 to 0.75 as "normal" priority; and values greater
   than 0.75 to 1.00 as "high" priority.  Specific implementations are
   free to establish alternative conventions for the grouping of
   priority values with the caveat that such conventions might not be
   understood by all implementations.
